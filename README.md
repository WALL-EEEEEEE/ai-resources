List of the best resources to learn the foundations of Artificial Intelligence
==============================================================================

This is a list of the best resources about AI that I could find on the web.
It will be the most useful for beginners, people who want to learn this field, but don't
know where to start.

I have developed a strategy for myself, for learning the basics of AI in the
fastest and most practical way, and I'm sure it will be useful to you as well.

Here's the list of the best resources to begin learning AI with:

### General overview of the field, most important topics:
- **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA)**  
http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Edition/dp/0136042597  
This is the best book about AI, and one of the best books written on any topic. Ever.
It may be challenging for a complete beginner, but it covers most of the topics
and fields of AI, and if you will read it - you will have a very solid
foundations of the field. This is definitely a best place to start.


- **Artificial Intelligence course on edx:**  
https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x-artificial-579#.U8ar941dV3s  
More lectures: https://www.youtube.com/user/CS188Spring2013  
This is an excellent course from Berkeley, series of video lectures, a lot of
them are based on AIMA, it is a perfect complement to the book, it will make it
much more understandable and enjoyable to read. Plus there's great practical projects.


### Lisp - best programming language for AI:
Of all the programming languages you can choose to practice AI there are 2 best
options: Lisp and Python. Lisp was created specifically for creating AI, and it
is widely considered to be the most elegant and brilliant programming language
ever.
Here's the best way to learn it:
- **Land of Lisp(lisp plus some AI):**  
http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812/  
This is an excellent and very fun introduction to lisp, makes learning very
enjoyable, understandable, and includes a lot of algorithms and basic principles
that will be very useful when you will be going throuhg AIMA.  
- **MIT course based on SICP book:**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&list=PLE18841CABEA24090#t=253  
This is a course on lisp and basics of computer science, based on one of the
most influential and seminal books in CS - "Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs".
- **Paul Graaham ANSI Common Lisp**  
http://www.amazon.com/ANSI-Common-LISP-Paul-Graham/dp/0133708756

### Machine Learning.:
Machine learning is the most "practical" and immediately useful subfield of AI,
which is great because focusing on learning it will allow you immediately
benefit from, and apply your knowledge on practical projects.

- **Andrew Ng:**  
https://www.coursera.org/course/ml

- **Pedro Domingos:**  
https://www.coursera.org/course/machlearning  

- **Programming Collective Intelligence**  
http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325


### How mind works:
On the opposite end of a spectrum - here's some fantastic(and very entertaining)
books about how human mind works. It is not necessary very practical, but they
are very exciting and fun to read, and obviously understanding of human brain
can be very useful. At the very least - you will be inspired and enjoy reading
them a lot.
- **Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence**  
http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533  
Audio: http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/On-Intelligence-Audiobook/B002V8LKTE

- **Ray Kurzweil - How to Create a Mind:**  
http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048/  
Audio: http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/How-to-Create-a-Mind-Audiobook/B009S7OKJS/

- **Principles of Neural Science**  
http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neural-Science-Edition-Kandel/dp/0071390111
This is the best book I could find that goes in depth into NS. 2 books above
presented the general theories how mind works, this one talks about hardcore
science, neuro-anatomy and such. Very interesting, but also very long - I'm
still reading it.
